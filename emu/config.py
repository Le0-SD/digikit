"""Where the firmware, its sections and the snapshots live.

Nothing in this project should hardcode a firmware filename. It did, in
thirteen files, and the cost was concrete: `emu.run` accepted a `.syx`
argument, passed it to nothing, and cheerfully ran a *different* firmware's
image and snapshots while printing the name you asked for. A hardcoded default
that silently wins over an explicit argument is worse than no default.

Every path here resolves in the same order:

    1. an explicit argument, if the caller passed one
    2. the environment variable
    3. discovery in the working directory
    4. an error that says what it looked for and how to tell it

Environment variables:

    DT2_SYX        the firmware .syx
    DT2_SECTIONS   the directory of extracted sections   (default: sections)
    DT2_SNAPSHOTS  the directory of boot snapshots        (default: snapshots)
    DT2_MAIN_IMG   the decompressed MAIN OS image

Discovery is by pattern, not by literal name, so another Elektron device's
sections work without editing anything -- `section_3_MAIN_OS.bin` is one
device's naming, not a law.
