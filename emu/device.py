"""Which product is this firmware, and what is on its front panel?

`emu/config.py` answers "which file", and `emu/symbols.py` answers "which
addresses". Neither answers "which DEVICE" -- config settles a tie between
firmware files by hardcoded FILENAME, which is how running one product under
another's name happens silently.

A device file under `devices/` is the missing piece. It carries only what the
image cannot tell us:

  * identity, keyed by the firmware's SHA-256. The filename is a hint for
    error messages; people rename firmware files, hashes do not change.
  * the wire mapping. The link carries (channel, bit) and the firmware reports
    a control code; channels 0..5 are linear and channel 6 is not, differently
    on each product.
  * display grouping, which is editorial -- it says how to arrange controls,
    not what they are.

Deliberately NOT here: control names and guest addresses. Names come from the
firmware's own factory-test tables via `emu/symbols.py`, and addresses are
resolved by signature. Freezing either into a data file would mean a new file
per firmware release and would lose exactly the property that makes both
products work from one code path.
