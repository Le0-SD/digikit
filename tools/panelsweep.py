"""Front-panel code map via the firmware's own `queue_send` event record.

There is no framebuffer to diff here -- and even if there were, it would be
the wrong tool. `tools/panelin.py` (the input side of this: see its module
docstring) delivers button and encoder events the way the UART8 driver does;
this is the *output* side, and it does not watch pixels change. It hooks the
one function the firmware itself calls to hand a decoded panel event to the
rest of the system, and reads the 16-byte record straight out of guest
memory at the moment of the call. That is immune to everything a framebuffer
diff has to fight: render timing (nothing has to have been drawn yet), modal
UI state (a menu screen intercepting a button does not stop it from being
queued), and frame tearing (there is no frame). The record is the firmware's
own classification of the input -- the ground truth this project has been
trying to observe indirectly this whole time.

RECORD LAYOUT (16 bytes). Two single-byte header fields are stable and
verified across dozens of samples on Digitone:

    +0x00  type    a single BYTE (not a 4-byte word -- see the note below),
                   0 for a button record, 1 for an encoder record in the
                   build this was verified against; discovered per build in
                   calibrate(), never assumed
    +0x07  code    a single byte: channel*8 + bit + 1 for buttons, channel +
                   1 for encoders on the verified build

Bytes 0x01-0x06 are unused padding on every sample seen. What comes after
the code byte is NOT a third fixed field, and this is the one genuinely
surprising thing this tool had to work around: a button record's flag byte
(0x01 press / 0x10 release) sits at +0x0B, while an encoder record's signed
delta byte sits at +0x08 -- two different sub-layouts sharing one 16-byte
frame, most likely a union of a button-event struct and an encoder-event
struct behind a common type+code header. Trusting one fixed offset for both
(as an early version of this tool did, following the natural but wrong
assumption that the whole record is four clean 4-byte big-endian words)
silently mis-decodes every encoder value as a huge, wrong constant: delta
+1 read as a 4-byte word starting at +0x08 is 0x01000000 (16777216), not 1,
because the actual delta byte is sitting at the MSB of that word, not the
whole word. Because of that trap, `code` and `value` are read as single
bytes at fixed offsets *within the header* (0x00, 0x07), but each record's
`value` offset (0x08 or 0x0B) is looked up from a table this tool derives
at runtime in calibrate() -- see below -- rather than assumed, so a build
whose layout differs would produce a loud calibration failure instead of a
quietly wrong table.

CALLING CONVENTION: `queue_send(queue*, item*)` is reached by `jsr`. On
entry the stack at A7 holds three big-endian 32-bit words: the return
address pushed by `jsr`, then the caller's `queue` and `item` pointer
arguments (pushed by the caller before the call). `item` points at the
16-byte record above, already filled in by the caller.

WHY NOTHING HERE IS A HARDCODED PER-BUILD ADDRESS. The two `queue_send`
*call sites* for buttons and encoders, and the queue they push onto, are
all inside the application image, which relocates between builds -- exactly
the class of address this project has a standing guardrail against carrying
from one firmware to another (see `emu/symbols.py`'s module docstring;
`emu/panelin.py` hardcoding Digitakt's UART8 ring pointer and silently
doing the wrong thing on Digitone is the concrete case that guardrail
exists because of). Only `queue_send` itself (0x40001896) is used as a
literal here, because it has been verified to sit at the same address in
both known builds -- consistent with `emu/symbols.py`'s finding that
RTOS-linked code sits at byte-identical offsets regardless of what the
application above it looks like, unlike the application's own call sites
into it.

So the two push call sites, and each record variant's value-byte offset,
are *discovered at runtime* instead of typed in:

  1. Hook `queue_send` unconditionally (every call, any caller) and, for
     each one, try to read a 16-byte record at `item`. A hit only becomes a
     *candidate* if the byte at +0x00 is 0 or 1 -- the record-shape filter.
     This alone is not enough: plenty of `queue_send` traffic unrelated to
     the panel can happen to look like a valid-shaped record by accident.
  2. Run a settle window with *no* input injected and record every
     (caller, item) pair that produces a shape-valid candidate anyway. That
     is the ignore-set: background noise that fires whether or not anyone
     touches the panel, built automatically from observed behaviour rather
     than a name -- it would just as well catch a second, unrelated,
     periodic queue_send this build has that Digitone didn't.
  3. Calibrate by injecting a small, known sequence of button and encoder
     events through `emu/panelin.py` and diffing the raw records they
     produce:
       - press(ch0,bit0) vs release(ch0,bit0): same code, different value
         -> the single byte offset where they differ is that build's
         button value_offset.
       - press(ch0,bit0) vs press(ch1,bit0): same value (both "press"),
         different code -> confirms the code offset.
       - encoder(ch0,+1) vs encoder(ch0,+5): same code, different value
         -> that build's encoder value_offset.
       - encoder(ch0,+1) vs encoder(ch1,+1): same value, different code
         -> confirms the code offset.
     Each diff is required to land on EXACTLY one byte; more than one (or
     zero) means the layout assumption does not hold on this build, and
     calibration fails loudly rather than guessing. The caller address of
     whichever probe answered is that build's push call site -- necessarily
     new, since it cannot have been in the settle-built ignore-set.
  4. The full sweep then just checks each probe's new record for one of
     the two calibrated callers, decodes it with that caller's discovered
     offsets, and reports it. A record that matches neither calibrated
     caller and isn't already in the ignore-set is genuinely new behaviour
     worth printing a warning about, not silently dropping.

INTRO HANDOVER: the supplied snapshots have the intro animation still
running. This tool spins with **no instruction cap** until the firmware's
own `intro_done` hook fires -- a capped settle has previously produced
several agents confidently reporting on a panel map that was still showing
the intro. The only thing that stops the wait early is the emulator itself
reporting a non-'limit' stop (a real crash), which is treated as a hard
failure (exit 2), never as "close enough, and moving on."

    Two modes, because Digitakt turned out to need both:

    `wanted_ret=None` (calibration, before any caller is known): injecting
    ANY panel input on Digitakt also kicks off a reactive burst of
    unrelated queue_send calls (empirically: a redraw/job queue -- same
    caller, identical payload, repeated 10-40+ times) that is absent from
    the no-input settle window, so the ignore-set never catches it, and it
    is not present at all on Digitone. Returning on the very first
    candidate would be wrong here: depending on scheduling, either the
    burst or the real record can come first, so "first" sometimes silently
    means "burst, not the real event." Instead this drains until the set
    of candidates stops growing for `quiet_chunks` consecutive steps, so
    by the time it returns, both the burst and the real one-shot record
    (wherever it landed) are present -- deciding which is which is
    calibrate()'s job, not this function's.

    `wanted_ret` given (the normal sweep, once calibration knows the real
    caller): wait specifically for that caller, up to `cap`, then give up.
    Once it HAS answered, this keeps watching for `quiet_chunks` more
    steps with no further instance of it before returning, in case a
    second one is right behind (drained here rather than leaking into the
    next probe).

    IMPORTANT, and the reason a `cap` timeout here is NOT retried with a
    bigger budget: Digitakt's encoder push (and, it turns out, some
    channel-6 buttons) can leave a value sitting un-flushed indefinitely --
    confirmed directly by idling 20M instructions with zero further input
    and getting nothing at all -- and it is the *next* injection into that
    same subsystem, not elapsed time, that flushes it. So a caller that
    gets a timeout here cannot fix it by waiting longer; the record may
    still show up, misattributed, during whatever the NEXT probe injects.
    `sweep_encoders`/`sign_check` account for this by identifying each
    record by its own content after the fact rather than by which probe's
    window it happened to land in -- see their docstrings.

    Digitakt can leave an encoder push un-flushed until the NEXT encoder
    push arrives, on any channel -- confirmed directly (see probe_wait's
    docstring): idling 20M instructions with nothing further injected
    produced nothing, but the very next push (a different channel) came
    back holding the STALE push's value instead of its own. So a probe for
    channel N can silently report channel N-1's answer, or nothing, if
    read naively per-probe. Since each channel's code (`channel + 1`,
    confirmed for channels 0 and 1 during calibration) is unique, this
    sidesteps the question entirely: every record seen across the WHOLE
    sweep is filed into `by_code` under its own decoded code regardless of
    which push caused it to surface, and each row is assembled afterwards
    by looking up `channel + 1` in that map. Extra trailing turns (bounded,
    same channel) are injected purely to flush out whatever is still
    pending once the main loop is done -- by induction on the single
    global slot this behaviour implies, one is enough to recover the very
