# Ghidra headless over the MAIN OS image, for the things dt2/coldfire.py cannot do.
#
# dt2/coldfire.py is a linear sweep. It has no cross-references, no function
# boundaries and no decompiler, and its "xref" substitute -- searching the image
# for the big-endian address constant -- silently misses PC-relative calls. That
# is not a corner case: `jsr $401772cc(pc)` at 0x4017845e encodes as 4eba ee6c
# and contains the target nowhere, so a byte search reports the function as
# never called while it is on the boot path. Use Ghidra whenever the question is
# "who calls this" or "what does this actually do".
#
#   tools/ghidra.sh import                 # one-time, ~3 min for the 3.1MB image
#   tools/ghidra.sh run MyScript.java [args...]
#
# GHIDRA_FOLDER=dt2-1.16 puts the program in that project folder, so several
# images named section_3_MAIN_OS.bin fit in one project; `run` then processes
# the program in that folder. tools/ghidracopy.py copies a program between
# projects.
#
# Scripts go in tools/ghidra/ and must be Java: this Ghidra is built without
# PyGhidra, so .py scripts fail with "Python is not available".
