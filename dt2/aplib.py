"""A store-only encoder for this firmware's aPLib-shaped container streams.

There is no LZ77 match-finder here on purpose. Byte-exact compression was
never the requirement: the device's own depacker (emu/oracle.py:depack,
0x80000432; the updater carries an identical copy at 0x80005710, see
emu/extract.py) accepts any stream that is a *valid* encoding of the bytes it
should produce -- nothing anywhere in the acceptance path hashes or compares
the compressed bytes, only the decompressed result. So a "compressor" that
emits every input byte as a literal is sufficient. It makes the output a
little *larger* than the input (about 12.5%, one extra tag byte per 8 literal
bytes, plus a ~16-byte terminator) -- that is expected and fine.

WHAT WAS EMPIRICALLY CONFIRMED, by single-stepping the real depacker under
Unicorn (see the disassembly at 0x80000432 in section 2 -- 354 bytes, one
`rts`) and cross-checking every claim below against emu/oracle.py:depack() on
hand-built streams:

  * The 8-byte section header ([u32 compressed_len][u32 byte_sum], big
    endian, sum over the bytes following the header) is skipped unconditionally
    (`addq.l #8,a0`) by the depacker itself. This module does not re-derive
    that convention -- it was already established by dt2/container.py and
    emu/extract.py -- but every round-trip below exercises it.

  * Tag bits are read MSB-first from a byte, refilled one byte at a time, via
    a classic "sentinel bit" shift register (not a separate bit counter).

  * LITERAL is tag bit **1** followed by one raw byte, copied straight to the
    output. This is the *opposite* polarity of the public aPLib reference
    (where 0 = literal) -- confirmed by single-stepping: the branch that does
    `move.b (a0),(a1)` and loops is the one taken when the extracted bit is 1.

  * Tag bit **0** enters a match path: an aPLib-style "gamma2" code is read
    (result=1; repeat result=result*2+databit until a raw stop-bit is seen).
    That much is confirmed. Two things about it are NOT fully reverse
    engineered, because this module never needs to emit a real match:
      - the stop-bit's polarity is INVERTED relative to the public reference
        (confirmed empirically: the loop keeps going while the raw bit is 0,
        and stops when the raw bit is 1);
      - what the gamma result and a following raw byte become (an LZ77
        offset, almost certainly) and how length is then coded, was traced
        only far enough to find the one thing this module actually uses --
        see below. The full match format is NOT documented here and this
        module cannot decode or emit one.

  * There is NO "first byte is always a literal" special case (the public
    aPLib reference has one; this device's routine does not). Confirmed
    because an all-terminator stream (no literals at all) round-trips to
    b'' -- see _self_test().

  * END OF STREAM was the hard part, and what was found is worth flagging
    clearly: the *only* branch in the whole 354-byte routine that reaches its
    epilogue (`movem.l (a7),d2-d5/a2; rts`) is
        cmpi.l #$2ff,d3 ; beq.w <epilogue>
    where d3 was *just* computed, on the "not a short 2-code" match path, as
    `(gamma_result << 8) + next_raw_byte` (confirmed by breakpointing that
    exact instruction and sweeping gamma_result/byte combinations). That
    formula's smallest possible value is 3*256+0 = 768 -- it can never
    naturally land on 0x2FF (767). This module's terminator exploits 32-bit
    wraparound instead: it gamma-codes the value 2**24 + 2 with a trailing
    byte of 0xFF, so (2**24+2)*256 + 255 == 0x2FF (mod 2**32) exactly. That
    branch has no side effects on the destination pointer, so it cleanly ends
    the stream after any run of literals, and it was verified against the
    real depacker for every case in _self_test() and every extracted section
    (see this file's __main__). Whether Elektron's own encoder ends its
    streams the same way is NOT known -- a real compressed stream is not
    available to compare against (only decompressed sections are, in
    sections/) -- so this is flagged as found-but-unexplained, not assumed.

Everything in the module docstring above is a hypothesis this module tests
against the real device, not documentation trusted on faith: run this file's
__main__ against a sections/ directory to see it re-confirmed.
